## Introduction
In this project, we aim to detect the heart diseases through the patient results without individually visiting the doctor. This is a machine learning project, used Logistic Regression for prediction.. I got very good results with the f1 accuracy of 87% for the first model and 85% for the second model. As Machine Learning model, I used Logistic Regression. The data is dummied before processing.

## Process and Libraries
### Process
For the first notebook data was collected from 302 people, the second dataset includes 1026 entries plus the first dataset in total the data is from 1328 patients.
 <li> 1.Data Exploring/ Cleaning üîç
 <li> 2.Data Transformation üì¶
 <li> 3.Analyzing the data ‚ö°Ô∏è
 <li> 4.Visualisation üìä
 <li> 5.Building the machine learning algorithm üß†
 <li> Interpretation the and evaluation of the model. 

 

### Libraries
During the analysis, i used following libraries:

<li>Numpy              
<li>Pandas            
<li>Matplotlib         
<li>Seaborn            
<li>ScikitLearn              

## Details

Data inludes the below columns: 
1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure  #The person's resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14.The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
